# Project Title

This project is designed to save time reading measured values from the FeLume output, saved as csv files.

## Getting Started

Download the Python script and place it in a folder with the csv files that you want to read. If other csv files are in the folder, this script will probably throw an error.

### Prerequisites

I used Spyder with Anaconda 3 as my Python viewer and engine. 

### Installing

Once this file is in the correct folder, feel free to try if it works with the test csv files uploaded.
I attached the output I get from this script using those files as "out.xlsx".



Happy concatenating!
